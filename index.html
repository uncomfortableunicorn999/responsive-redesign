        <h3>A redesign of Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation's website</h3>
        <h3> <a href="https://mountainthunder.com/">old website</a></h3>
        <h3> <a href="https://uncomfortableunicorn999.github.io/mountain_thunder/">redesigned website</a></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="d-flex flex-column background1 justify-content-center  bg-white" style="padding-bottom:1cm;">
        <h3>The Original Website</h3>
        <p style="margin-right:20%;">The original website can be found <a href="https://mountainthunder.com/">here</a>. Mountain Thunder Plantation is a coffee farm on the big island of
            Hawai'i; there website serves both information and business purposes as you can order coffee from the site.
            
            <br> When I was first looking at the site, there was a second alert on the home page; an image of that site is shown below.</p>
        <img class='original-image' src="./assets/mountain_thunder_original.png">
        <h4>Issues with the Original Website</h4>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column"><h5>Learnability</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>There are too many tabs for exploration for drop down menus</li>
                <li>If you want to order you first have to login, but you can get to the ordering page without doing so
                </li>
                <li>because there is a side menu bar and a top menu bar it just leaves too many places for people to have search for the information they are trying to find</li>
                <li>If you are trying to find information as well, there are dead radio buttons that don’t lead to anywhere and you can’t actually select anything from them.</li>
                <li>The spacing on the top menu bar is also confusing (is it Farm, Tours or Farm Tours)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>They are suffereing from a barage of infromation that it is overwhelming for new users to learn to use
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul></div>
            <div class="column"><h5>Memorability</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The double navigation methods would be an issue</li>
                <li>Remembering to scroll down to the bottom to sign in,even if you know what you are doing, it is a pain to scroll to the bottom</li>
                <li> Still the too many links might be hard for users to remember which page they clicked on to get where</li>
            </ul></div>
             <div class="column"><h5>Design Issues</h5>
             <ul>
                 <li>Overcrowding</li>
                 <li>Doubled information on multiple pages (the video on the home page is also on the tour page, which is why I removed it)</li>
                 <li>Unclear Hierarchy for ordering the coffee on the home page (which doesn't even make sense to have ordering on the home page when there is a shopping page)</li>
                 <li>Inconsistent font size and usage</li>
             </ul></div>
            </div>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <h5>WAVE Report</h5>
    <p>The WAVE report for mountain thunder can be found <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/report#/mountainthunder.com">here</a> Below is the summary of results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>40 contrast errors</li>
            <li>A few cases of missing alt text, but generally they do a very good job</li>
            <li>A few cases of too small text</li>
            <li>Multiple links that do not lead anywhere</li>
            <li>The radio buttons for ordering do not have a group</li>
            <li>Empty buttons and redundant links</li>
        </ul>
    <p>I agree with this report especially on the contrast errors. The website is hard to read because of the style chosen
        I kept this in mind while redesigning.
